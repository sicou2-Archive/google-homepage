Assignment: 

Easy: Build Google.com homepage
In project folder, create index.html file

1 Tips:
  * Dont be a perfectionist! Make it look like Google.com, not act like Google.com. Not pixel 
    perfect. Dropdown and hover-highlighting can be ignored
  * Use Google. 
  * Ensure live server extension in VSCode is working. 
  * If stuck with buttons or inputs, look in to css property -webkit-appearence: none; or 
    -moz-appearance
  * Google logo: https://www.google.com/images/branding/googlelogo/1x/googlelogo_color_272x92dp.png
  2 Start with main elements. The Logo, the search bar, and the two buttons. 
  3 Next do the navbar
  4 Last do the footer
  5 Do as much by hand before moving to other tools. 
  Push to GH

Difficult: Build Google.com search results page.
Much of the previous code should be reuseable. 
Ignore links to nowhere and forms that do not submit. 
Hardcode search results
Focus on placement and order of items on the page
